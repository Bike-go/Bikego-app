        <strong id="what-are-cookies">What are cookies?</strong><br><br>

        websites are loaded in a browser. They are widely used to remember you and your preferences, either for a single
        visit (through a “<strong>session cookie</strong>”) or for multiple repeat visits (using a “<strong>persistent
            cookie</strong>”).
        <br><br>

        <strong>Session cookies</strong> are temporary cookies that are used during the course of your visit to the
        Website, and they
        expire when you close the web browser.<br><br>

        Cookies may be set by the Website (“<strong>first-party cookies</strong>”), or by third parties, such as those
